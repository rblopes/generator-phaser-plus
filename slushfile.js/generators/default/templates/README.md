Development Instructions 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following `npm` scripts are available to you, performing the tasks as
described below.

```sh
npm start     # Launch a development server. Same as `gulp dev`.
npm run dist  # Prepare the game release for distribution. Also `gulp dist`.
npm run clean # Delete temporary and distribution build files.
```

(Also, you may want to install Gulp globally, but you are not required to do
so.)

Should you consider distributing your game as an open source project, please
[include a LICENSE file][lcnc] in your project root.

Congrats and happy coding!
